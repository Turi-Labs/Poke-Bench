gpt-4.1's Reasoning: To create a well-balanced team with great type coverage and overwhelming power, I chose Mewtwo for unrivaled Psychic offense, Metagross for Steel and Psychic utility with impressive bulk and resistances, Salamence for powerful Dragon and Flying coverage and a fast physical attacker, Swampert for excellent Water/Ground typing that covers Electric, Fire, and Rock types, Gengar for Ghost/Poison types enabling it to counter Psychics and Fairies, and Zapdos as an Electric/Flying versatile threat that checks Water, Flying, and Ground types. This core provides strong answers to most type threats, both offensive and defensive prowess, and strategic flexibility.

o4-mini's Reasoning: I chose a team that maximizes type coverage and bulk while covering each other’s weaknesses. Kyogre (79) provides powerful Water STAB and great bulk. Groudon (80) adds Ground STAB to handle Electric and Rock threats. Rayquaza (78) brings Dragon/Flying STAB to cover Grass, Ground, and Fighting. Lugia (60) serves as a bulky Psychic/Flying pivot, handling Fighting and Grass. Magnezone (33) is Electric/Steel for key resistances and Electric coverage. Ho-Oh (61) adds Fire/Flying STAB, dealing with Steel, Bug, and Grass threats.

o3's Reasoning: I built a well-rounded squad that covers all major attacking types, mixes physical and special offense, and has solid defensive synergy. Swampert (72) is a bulky Water/Ground pivot that checks Fire, Rock and Electric threats while providing Stealth Rock support; its only 4× Grass weakness is handled by Zapdos and Salamence. Zapdos (6) offers fast special Electric/Flying offense, a crucial Ground immunity and answers Grass types that menace Swampert. Metagross (77) supplies a Steel/Psychic tank with huge physical power, resisting Ice and Rock attacks that trouble our fliers and smashing Fairy, Rock or Ice foes. Blissey (68) is the premier special wall and cleric, soaking up special hits that the rest of the team dislikes and providing recovery support. Gengar (4) gives speed, powerful Ghost/Poison coverage and immunities to Fighting and Normal, punishing common threats and spreading status. Salamence (76) acts as a mixed physical sweeper and late-game cleaner, completing strong Dragon/Flying coverage while benefiting from the Ice and Rock resistances of Metagross and Swampert. Together these six create balanced type coverage, multiple immunities, complementary resistances and a mix of wallbreaking, sweeping and defensive roles.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: This team provides excellent type coverage and a mix of offensive and defensive capabilities. Mewtwo offers incredible power and speed. Dragonite brings physical strength and typing versatility. Gengar provides Ghost/Poison coverage and high Special Attack. Zapdos offers Electric typing and good Special Attack. Tyranitar brings Rock/Dark coverage and bulk. Swampert rounds out the team with Water/Ground typing and balanced stats.

claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219's Reasoning: I selected a balanced team with diverse type coverage and strong stats. Tyranitar provides Rock/Dark coverage with excellent bulk and attack. Swampert covers Water/Ground types and has good HP. Zapdos brings Electric/Flying coverage with strong special attack and speed. Blaziken offers Fire/Fighting types with balanced offensive stats. Metagross contributes Steel/Psychic typing with excellent physical stats and defense. Finally, Celebi rounds out the team with Psychic/Grass coverage and perfectly balanced stats across all categories.

claude-sonnet-4-20250514's Reasoning: I'm building a balanced team with excellent type coverage and synergy. Mewtwo serves as my primary special sweeper with incredible psychic power. Tyranitar provides physical attacking prowess and covers dark/rock types while offering sandstorm support. Swampert gives me crucial water/ground coverage with no weaknesses except grass (4x). Skarmory is my defensive steel wall that can set up hazards and counter physical attackers. Gengar provides speed, ghost typing for immunities, and can handle psychic threats that might trouble my team. Finally, Blaziken rounds out the team with fire/fighting coverage and mixed attacking capabilities. This team covers all major offensive types while having strong defensive synergy - Skarmory walls physical attacks, Tyranitar handles special attacks with sand support, and Swampert resists common attacking types. The speed distribution is balanced with fast sweepers (Mewtwo, Gengar) and bulky attackers (Tyranitar, Swampert).

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: This team is built around a powerful Steel/Water/Dragon core, providing a fantastic balance of offense, defense, and type synergy. Metagross serves as the primary bulky physical attacker with an outstanding typing. Swampert is a bulky pivot whose Water/Ground typing provides a crucial immunity to Electric attacks and covers the Fire and Ground weaknesses of other members. Salamence is the primary fast sweeper, capable of running physical or mixed sets to break through opponent's teams. To round out the core, Raikou acts as a dedicated fast special attacker to pressure Water and Flying types. Finally, Skarmory and Blissey form the classic 'SkarmBliss' defensive backbone, capable of walling nearly all physical and special attackers in the game, respectively, providing longevity and setup opportunities for the rest of the team.

gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: This team is designed for a balance of offensive power, defensive resilience, and broad type coverage. Swampert (Water/Ground) provides excellent defensive typing with an Electric immunity and resistances to Fire, Rock, Steel, and Poison, although it has a glaring 4x weakness to Grass. Venusaur (Grass/Poison) serves as a counter to Water and other Grass types, resisting Fighting and Fairy attacks, and covering Swampert's Grass weakness. Dragonite (Dragon/Flying) is a powerful physical attacker with a Ground immunity and strong offensive presence against Grass and Fighting types, though it is 4x weak to Ice. Metagross (Steel/Psychic) is a robust physical tank and attacker, resisting a multitude of types including Ice, Dragon, Flying, Psychic, and Fairy, effectively covering Dragonite's primary weaknesses. Jolteon (Electric) offers high speed and special attack, providing coverage against Flying and Water types, crucial for speed control and breaking through faster threats. Gengar (Ghost/Poison) adds a fast special attacker with immunities to Normal and Fighting, vital for handling common threats, and provides powerful STAB options against Psychic and Grass types. The team's diverse typings and balanced stats allow for effective offensive pressure against a wide range of opponents and strategic defensive switching to mitigate weaknesses.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Metagross is weak to Ghost-type moves due to its Steel/Psychic typing, making Shadow Ball super effective. Mewtwo is at full HP and outspeeds Metagross, so attacking with Shadow Ball gives the highest chance to deal strong damage immediately.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Mewtwo is a Psychic-type Pokémon, which means my Metagross's Steel typing provides a resistance to its primary STAB attacks. Mewtwo's physical defense is generally lower than its special defense, making my physical attacker Metagross a strong offensive threat. Earthquake is my most powerful and reliable move available, so I'll use it to inflict maximum damage on the first turn.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Metagross has only 5 HP remaining and any of Mewtwo's moves will likely knock it out. Shadow Ball is super effective against Metagross' Steel/Psychic typing and was used successfully last turn. Using Shadow Ball again is the safest way to ensure Metagross is knocked out without risking a switch.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Metagross has only 5 HP remaining and will surely be knocked out by Mewtwo's next attack. The best strategic move is to switch to a Pokémon that can absorb the incoming damage. Blissey has extremely high HP and Special Defense, making it the ideal wall against a special attacker like Mewtwo. It can take a Shadow Ball with ease and create a better position for my team.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Shadow Ball had no effect on Blissey since it is a Normal type, and Psychic is resisted. Blissey has high special defense, but switching to Metagross (Steel/Psychic) would provide a strong physical attacker who resists Blissey's likely Normal-type moves and can hit back harder.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: My Blissey is immune to Mewtwo's known move, Shadow Ball, so I am not in any danger. Mewtwo's HP is low enough that an attack might knock it out. I will use Ice Beam to apply pressure and potentially win the matchup.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Metagross resists Ice Beam and is currently healthy. Blissey has very high HP but low Defense, making physical moves like Earthquake highly effective. Earthquake is also super effective against Blissey's Normal-type, so it's the best move to maximize damage.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: My active Pokémon, Blissey, has a move that is not very effective against the opponent's Metagross. Metagross is a powerful physical attacker, which is Blissey's weak point. I will switch to Swampert, whose Ground typing is super-effective against Metagross's Steel type. Swampert also resists Steel-type attacks, making it a safe and advantageous switch.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Earthquake did significant damage to Swampert previously and is Metagross's strongest move. Despite Swampert's Water typing, it is also a Ground type, so Earthquake will deal neutral damage. Keeping up the offensive pressure is preferable since Metagross still has high HP and is not at a clear type disadvantage.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: My active Pokémon, Swampert, has a Ground type. The opponent's Metagross is a Steel/Psychic type, making it weak to Ground-type moves. My Swampert's Earthquake is a powerful STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) super-effective attack that will deal maximum damage and has a very high probability of knocking out the opponent's Metagross in one hit. Since it is my turn to move, this is the most direct path to victory against this specific opponent.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Metagross is at critically low HP (3/120) and will almost certainly be KO'd by another Earthquake. Swampert is weak to Grass-type moves, but none of my Pokémon currently on the field have that advantage. Of my available team, Salamence can threaten Swampert with a potential Dragon- or Flying-type move and resists Earthquake because of its Flying type. Switching to Salamence both preserves Metagross for later and prevents a likely KO.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: The opponent's Metagross has only 3 HP remaining. My Swampert's Earthquake is super-effective and will guarantee a knockout. Although my Swampert is low on HP, it's crucial to eliminate the threat before the opponent can act.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Swampert is at very low HP (21/140) and is weak to Dragon-type moves. 'Dragon Claw' is a reliable attack with 100% accuracy and enough power to guarantee the KO. Salamence is at full health and faces no immediate threat from Swampert, since Earthquake has no effect. Using Dragon Claw is the safest way to secure the knockout without risking a miss from Fire Blast or being resisted by Earthquake.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: My Swampert is very low on health and slower than Salamence, so it will likely be knocked out this turn. Attacking with Ice Beam is risky. A safer play is to switch to a Pokémon that can handle Salamence. Skarmory is an excellent choice as it has a 4x resistance to Dragon-type attacks and is immune to Ground-type attacks, making it a strong defensive counter to Salamence.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Skarmory is Steel/Flying type, making it 4x weak to Fire moves and resistant to Dragon and Ground. Salamence is at full HP and outspeeds Skarmory. Fire Blast is the best offensive option here, likely KOing Skarmory. Despite its imperfect accuracy, Fire Blast is strongly favored for maximum damage.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Salamence's Dragon Claw is not very effective against my Skarmory, but a potential Fire-type move would be devastating. Switching to Raikou is the best strategic move. Raikou's Electric-type moves are super-effective against Salamence's Flying type, and Raikou has a high Speed stat, likely allowing it to attack first and threaten a one-hit KO.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Raikou is an Electric-type, which is weak to Ground-type moves. Salamence knows Earthquake, a powerful Ground-type attack with perfect accuracy. Salamence is currently at full HP and faster than most Raikou sets. Attacking with Earthquake provides the best chance to deal significant damage or even knock out Raikou.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: My Raikou is faster than the opponent's Salamence. My move, Thunderbolt, receives a Same-Type Attack Bonus (STAB) and is super-effective against Salamence's Flying type. This gives me a very high chance to knock out Salamence in a single hit before it can attack me again. This is the most efficient way to eliminate the current threat.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Raikou has fainted and the opponent is about to send out a new Pokémon. Salamence is at less than half HP and could be easily knocked out depending on the opponent's next choice. Swampert is currently at full HP and has great defensive typing with few common weaknesses. Switching to Swampert is a safer play to handle most possible threats and preserve Salamence for later.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Blissey is the best choice due to its massive HP and high Special Defense, allowing it to safely absorb any attack from Salamence. Most importantly, Blissey can learn Ice-type moves which are 4x super-effective against the opponent's Dragon/Flying type, ensuring a knockout on the weakened Salamence.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: The opponent's Salamence is a Dragon/Flying type, making it 4x weak to my Blissey's Ice Beam. Given Salamence's low remaining HP, Ice Beam is almost certain to secure a knockout. My Blissey has full HP and can withstand any single attack from Salamence, making this the safest and most effective play.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Blissey has very high Special Defense, which lessens the impact of Surf and Ice Beam, both special moves. Earthquake is a physical move that is super effective against Blissey's Normal-type and targets its much lower Defense, making it the most effective choice to deal significant damage.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Blissey has very low physical Defense and is extremely vulnerable to Swampert's physical STAB attacks like Earthquake. Switching to Salamence is the optimal play. Salamence's Flying type makes it immune to Ground moves and it resists Water-type moves, completely walling the opponent's Swampert. At full health, Salamence can then apply significant offensive pressure.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Salamence is a Dragon/Flying-type Pokémon, making it 4x weak to Ice-type moves like Ice Beam. Swampert still has high HP and can survive a hit, making it safe to go for a super effective attack.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: My opponent's known move, Earthquake, does not affect my Salamence due to its Flying type, giving me a free turn to attack. Dragon Claw is my best offensive option, as it receives a Same-Type Attack Bonus (STAB), making it more powerful than Earthquake against a target it hits for neutral damage. This allows me to deal significant damage while the opponent is at a disadvantage.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Opponent needs to send out a new Pokémon, and I don't know what it will be yet. Swampert is low on HP (45/140) and could be easily KO'd, but switching now could give the opponent a free attack on my switch-in. Swampert has already done a great job taking out Salamence. Gengar and Zapdos are both at full HP and are flexible safe pivots. Sending out Gengar prepares me to outspeed and threaten many possible opponents, while preserving Swampert for potential later use as a sack or useful resist. I will switch to Gengar.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Skarmory is the safest and most strategic choice. Its Flying type grants a crucial immunity to Swampert's Ground-type STAB attacks. With high physical defense and healthy HP, it can easily withstand a potential Water-type move. It can safely switch in and finish off the low-HP Swampert, likely moving first due to its higher speed stat.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: My active Pokémon, Skarmory, has a significant type advantage. Its Flying type makes it immune to Swampert's known move, Earthquake. The opposing Swampert is at low health and can likely be knocked out by a single attack. Switching to any other Pokémon is risky, as Metagross and my own Swampert are at critical HP, and Blissey cannot apply enough offensive pressure. The best strategy is to stay in and attack to secure the knockout.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Skarmory is a Steel/Flying-type Pokémon, which means it is weak to Electric attacks. Thunderbolt, being Electric-type, is super effective against Skarmory. Gengar is at full HP and has a type advantage, so using Thunderbolt maximizes my chances to deal heavy damage and potentially knock out Skarmory.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Gengar is a fast and powerful special attacker. It likely carries a move like Thunderbolt which would be super-effective against Skarmory's Flying type. Switching to Blissey is the safest play. Blissey's Normal typing makes it immune to Gengar's Ghost-type STAB, and its massive Special Defense and HP can easily absorb any potential coverage move like Focus Blast or Thunderbolt, effectively walling the Gengar.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Gengar resists Ice Beam and cannot be hit by Blissey's common Normal-type STAB moves due to its Ghost typing. Thunderbolt did decent damage, but Shadow Ball is STAB and hits Blissey for neutral damage (since Blissey is not weak to Electric nor Ghost). Shadow Ball has slightly lower base power but benefits from STAB, making it the optimal choice for consistent damage against Blissey.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: My Blissey is a special wall and is taking very little damage from Gengar's Thunderbolt. My other available Pokémon are at very low HP and would be at risk if I switched. By staying in and attacking with Ice Beam, I can slowly chip away at Gengar's health while maintaining my strong defensive position, forcing my opponent to find a better answer.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Shadow Ball does not affect Blissey due to its Normal typing. However, Thunderbolt is a neutral attack and can deal consistent damage. Switching is less favorable right now, as Gengar still has healthy HP and is not threatened by Ice Beam. I will attack with Thunderbolt to chip away at Blissey's large HP.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Gengar's Ghost-type attacks do not affect my Normal-type Blissey. Blissey has extremely high Special Defense and HP, so it can easily withstand a Thunderbolt from Gengar. Continuing to attack with Ice Beam is the most efficient way to knock out Gengar without taking any significant risk.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Gengar is at very low HP (39/110), and will likely faint if Blissey uses Ice Beam again. Thunderbolt did only modest damage last turn, and Shadow Ball may do more since Blissey typically has low Defense; however, Gengar may not survive another hit. Switching to Zapdos, who is at full HP and resists Ice moves, allows for maintaining offensive pressure while preserving Gengar for later.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Gengar's HP is critically low at 39. My Blissey's Ice Beam dealt 36 damage last turn, so using it again will secure the knockout. There is no need to switch and risk taking damage on another Pokémon.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Zapdos is currently threatened by Blissey's super effective Ice Beam, and with only 68 HP left, another Ice Beam would likely knock Zapdos out. Blissey typically has very high Special Defense, making Electric attacks less effective, and my other options are either severely weakened or also weak to Ice. Swampert resists Ice Beam and is immune to Electric attacks, so switching to Swampert both absorbs the Ice Beam better and allows for more strategic play in future turns.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Blissey's Ice Beam is super effective against Zapdos and did significant damage last turn. With only 68 HP remaining, another Ice Beam is highly likely to secure the knockout. My Blissey is very healthy and can take a hit if needed. There is no reason to switch.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Swampert is at critically low HP and will likely be knocked out by another Ice Beam from Blissey. Switching to Metagross as a sacrifice could provide a safe switch for another teammate since Metagross has only 3 HP left and would be knocked out immediately. This would give me a free switch into another Pokémon, such as Mewtwo or Salamence, to better deal with Blissey.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: The opponent's Swampert has very low HP (12/140). My Blissey's Ice Beam is 4x super effective and will guarantee a knockout. There is no need to switch as attacking is the most direct way to eliminate this threat.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Blissey is a Normal-type Pokémon with very high HP and Special Defense but low Defense. My best approach is to use a strong physical attacker. Salamence fits this role well, boasting high Attack and decent Speed, which can exploit Blissey's low Defense. Although Salamence is not at full health, its remaining HP (51/135) is sufficient for at least one or two powerful physical attacks. Mewtwo, though strong, is mainly a special attacker, and Gengar is frail with little HP left. Swampert and Zapdos both lack notable advantages and also have low HP. Thus, Salamence is the most likely to finish off Blissey quickly.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Blissey's Defense is low but its Special Defense is very high. Salamence's Earthquake is a powerful physical move and exploits Blissey's low Defense, while Salamence outspeeds Blissey and can deal significant damage. Switching is risky with all teammates fairly low on HP and Blissey potentially using Ice Beam again. Attacking with Earthquake is the most effective play.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: My opponent has to switch to a new Pokémon, giving me a free turn. Blissey has done its job by knocking out Metagross. I will switch to Skarmory, which has a great defensive typing (Steel/Flying), is immune to the opponent's known move Earthquake, and has a healthy amount of HP. This puts me in a strong defensive position to scout and react to their next Pokémon.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Earthquake has no effect on Skarmory because it is a Flying type. Dragon Claw will do neutral damage, but Fire Blast is super effective against Skarmory's Steel typing, and could deal heavy damage or possibly knock it out. Despite Fire Blast's lower accuracy, it is the strongest available move and gives the best chance to finish Skarmory quickly. Salamence still has enough HP to risk another turn.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: The opponent's Salamence is faster than my Skarmory and carries Fire Blast, which is a super-effective, one-hit-KO threat. Switching is the only safe play. My Blissey has enormous special defense and HP, allowing it to easily absorb a Fire Blast. Blissey can then threaten Salamence with a super-effective attack on the next turn. This switch safely neutralizes the opponent's biggest remaining threat.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Blissey has very high Special Defense, making Fire Blast less effective over time. Dragon Claw is a physical move that takes advantage of Blissey's weak Defense. Earthquake is also physical and stronger, but Blissey is not weak to Ground. Staying in with Salamence is a risk because Blissey knows Ice Beam, which is super effective against Salamence. However, my other Pokémon are all very low except for Zapdos (which is weak to Ice Beam) and Mewtwo (which has decent HP left). If I switch, Blissey could hit the switch-in with Ice Beam or another move. The best option is to attack with Earthquake to deal the most physical damage before Salamence faints.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: The opponent's Salamence is a Dragon/Flying type, making it 4x weak to my Blissey's Ice Beam. With only 51 HP remaining, Ice Beam is a guaranteed knockout. Although Salamence will likely attack first, Blissey has enough HP to survive another hit. Eliminating a powerful threat like Salamence is the highest priority.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Blissey has fainted, so the opponent will be forced to send in a new Pokémon. Salamence is low on HP but still active, and no switches are allowed right now before seeing which Pokémon the opponent sends out. I will wait for the opponent to reveal their next Pokémon before deciding to attack or switch.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Skarmory has the most remaining HP and its Steel/Flying typing provides a key resistance to Salamence's Dragon-type STAB attacks. Its high Defense stat allows it to withstand physical attacks. My other Pokémon have too little HP to safely switch in.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: My active Pokémon, Skarmory, has a major type advantage against the opponent's Salamence. Skarmory's Flying type makes it immune to Earthquake, and its Steel type gives it resistance to Dragon Claw. The opposing Salamence is at low health. Switching out to either Metagross or Swampert is extremely risky as they both have very little HP remaining and would likely be knocked out. The best strategy is to stay in and attack to secure the knockout.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Fire Blast is super effective against Skarmory's Steel typing, potentially dealing heavy damage despite its lower accuracy. Salamence still has enough HP to survive an attack and make use of this strong offensive move. Switching out risks unnecessary damage to lower-HP Pokémon. Best to take advantage of Salamence's offensive presence.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Switching is not a viable option as my other Pokémon, Metagross and Swampert, have critically low HP and would be knocked out by any of Salamence's attacks. My best chance to win is to stay in with Skarmory and attack. Salamence is low on health and a strong attack could knock it out. While Skarmory is weak to Fire Blast, it resists Dragon Claw and is immune to Earthquake, giving me a decent chance to survive and retaliate for the win.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Since Skarmory has fainted, the opponent needs to send out a new Pokémon. Until I know the identity of their next Pokémon, I should wait and observe before choosing an attack or switching. No action is required right now.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Metagross has only 5 HP and will be knocked out by any attack from Salamence. Swampert has more remaining HP and a better chance to survive a hit. As a Water-type, Swampert may know an Ice-type move, which is 4x super-effective against a Dragon/Flying type like Salamence and offers the best chance to win.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: My Swampert is very low on HP and slower than Salamence, so it will likely be knocked out this turn. Switching is not a viable option, as Metagross has even less HP (5) and would be knocked out by any of Salamence's attacks. My only chance to win is to attack with the most powerful move available. Ice Beam is 4x super effective against the opponent's Dragon/Flying type Salamence and will guarantee a knockout if it hits. I must hope Swampert can survive the incoming attack.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Swampert's Water/Ground typing makes it 4x weak to Grass and immune to Electric, but neither of my available Pokémon have Grass moves by type. Zapdos's Electric typing is nullified by Swampert's Ground type, making its STAB less effective; however, Zapdos still resists potential Ground-type moves with its Flying type and has enough HP to survive. Gengar is low on HP and is generally frail. Mewtwo has high Speed and strong special attack, but Psychic-type moves are neutral. Given the considerations, Mewtwo has the best combination of speed, power, and remaining HP to safely finish off the low-HP Swampert before taking much damage.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Mewtwo is faster than Swampert and Swampert has only 21 HP remaining. Using Psychic will be sufficient to KO Swampert, and there is no risk in staying in as Swampert is unlikely to survive the attack. No need to switch Pokémon at this stage.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: My only other available Pokémon, Metagross, has only 5 HP remaining, making a switch incredibly risky. My best option is to keep Swampert in and attempt to deal as much damage as possible. The opponent knows I have Ice Beam after knocking out their Salamence, so they may switch to a Pokémon that resists Ice, like a Steel or Fire type. Earthquake is my strongest STAB move and is super-effective against both Steel and Fire types, making it the most logical predictive move in this situation.

gpt-4.1's Reasoning: Mewtwo is at moderate HP and is currently active. The opponent must switch in a new Pokémon, and I do not yet know its identity or typing. Mewtwo's movepool provides diverse coverage, so keeping it in allows for a strong, versatile response to whatever the opponent brings in. There is no immediate threat requiring a switch. Remaining offensive pressure is important while maintaining momentum.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Metagross is my only remaining Pokémon. Although its HP is critically low, I have no other option but to send it out. Its Steel typing gives it a valuable resistance to Mewtwo's Psychic-type attacks, which is my only hope.

gemini-2.5-pro's Reasoning: Metagross is my last Pokémon and has only 5 HP remaining. It will certainly be knocked out this turn. Switching is not an option. My only play is to deal as much damage as possible before fainting. Earthquake has the highest base power among my moves, making it the optimal choice for this final attack.






















---

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Mewtwo is a strong Psychic-type Pokemon, but Kyogre is a Water-type legendary with high defensive stats. While Psychic would be a neutral hit, Thunderbolt (Electric-type) would be super effective against Kyogre due to its Water typing. This gives us the best chance to deal significant damage right from the start of the battle.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Kyogre is already low on HP, and Thunderbolt was super effective. Another Thunderbolt should be enough to knock it out. Mewtwo still has decent HP, so it's worth staying in to finish off Kyogre rather than switching.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Groudon is a Ground/Fire type, which is weak to Ice-type moves. Mewtwo's Ice Beam would be super effective against Groudon. Additionally, Mewtwo's HP is relatively low, so dealing maximum damage quickly is crucial.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Swampert is the best choice for this situation. As a Water/Ground type, it has a significant advantage against Groudon, which is a pure Ground type. Water moves will be super effective against Groudon. Additionally, Swampert's Ground typing makes it immune to Groudon's Electric-type moves if it has any. Swampert also has full HP (140/140) and decent defensive stats, which means it can potentially take hits from Groudon if needed. Its Attack stat of 95 is also respectable, allowing it to deal good damage with its Water-type moves. The fact that Groudon is already low on HP (23/140) means Swampert should be able to finish it off quickly, possibly even in one hit with a strong Water-type move.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Groudon is at very low HP (23/140) and is weak to Water-type moves. Swampert's Surf attack is super effective against Groudon and has a high chance of finishing the battle. Additionally, using a Water-type move eliminates the risk of Groudon's Earthquake being super effective against Swampert.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Rayquaza is a Dragon/Flying type, which is weak to Ice-type moves. Our Swampert knows Ice Beam, which would be super effective against Rayquaza. This is our best option for dealing maximum damage and potentially knocking out Rayquaza quickly.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Since Rayquaza has fainted and the opponent needs to choose a new Pokémon, this is a good opportunity to switch out Swampert. Swampert's HP is low at 53/140, and we don't know what type of Pokémon the opponent will send out next. Dragonite is a strong, versatile Pokémon with full HP, making it a good choice for this uncertain situation. Its Dragon and Flying type gives it fewer weaknesses compared to Swampert, and it likely has a diverse movepool to handle various opponent types.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Dragonite is at low HP and vulnerable to Lugia's Psychic attacks. Earthquake won't be effective against Lugia due to its Flying type, and Fire Punch isn't very effective either. It's best to switch to a Pokémon with better type matchup and full HP. Tyranitar, being part Dark-type, resists Psychic attacks and has full HP, making it the best choice for this situation.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Tyranitar has a type advantage against Lugia, being immune to Psychic-type moves. We should capitalize on this by using our strongest super-effective move. Crunch is a Dark-type move that will be super effective against Lugia's Psychic typing. It also has 100% accuracy, making it a reliable choice.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Tyranitar is at low HP and vulnerable to Lugia's Psychic attacks. Switching to Gengar would provide resistance to Psychic moves and allow for a safe switch. Gengar is at full HP and can potentially deal super effective damage with Ghost-type moves if it has any.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Tyranitar is the best choice for this situation. As a Rock/Dark type, it has a significant advantage against Lugia's Psychic/Flying typing. Rock moves are super effective against Flying, while Dark moves are super effective against Psychic. Additionally, Tyranitar's Dark typing provides immunity to Psychic attacks. Although Tyranitar's HP is relatively low at 58/140, its high Defense (95) and Special Defense (90) stats should help it withstand Lugia's attacks. Tyranitar's Attack stat of 114 is also the highest among the available options, allowing it to deal substantial damage. While Zapdos has full HP and an Electric type advantage, it's also weak to Lugia's Psychic moves due to its Flying type. Dragonite and Swampert don't have as favorable type matchups against Lugia.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Zapdos is a strong choice against Lugia due to its Electric typing. Lugia is part Flying-type, which is weak to Electric moves. Thunderbolt has higher accuracy than Thunder, making it a more reliable choice. It's super effective and should deal significant damage to Lugia, potentially finishing it off given its current HP.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Zapdos is at full health and has a type advantage against Ho-Oh, which is Flying-type. Thunderbolt has already proven effective, and it has a higher accuracy than Thunder. With Ho-Oh at low HP, Thunderbolt should be sufficient to finish it off without risking a miss.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Zapdos' Electric-type moves are ineffective against Groudon due to its Ground type. Switching to a Water-type Pokémon like Swampert would be advantageous, as it's strong against Ground types and can resist Groudon's Earthquake.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Swampert is at critically low HP and vulnerable to Groudon's Earthquake. Groudon is also low on HP, so a strong attack could end the battle. Surf is super effective against Ground-type Groudon and has a high chance of KO'ing it. Using Surf is the best option to potentially win before Swampert faints.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Swampert is at critically low HP and vulnerable to Magnezone's Electric-type attacks. Earthquake would be super effective against Magnezone due to its Steel typing, but Swampert might not survive another hit. Switching to Zapdos is the safest option as it resists Electric attacks and is at full health, allowing us to better assess the situation and potentially set up for a win.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Zapdos is at low HP and vulnerable. Magnezone is also Electric-type, so our Electric moves won't be very effective. It's better to switch to a Pokémon with a type advantage. Swampert, being part Ground-type, is immune to Electric attacks and can deal super-effective damage to Magnezone. Although Swampert's HP is low, it's our best option to potentially finish off Magnezone quickly.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Swampert has a significant type advantage against Magnezone, being immune to Electric attacks and having access to super-effective Ground-type moves. Earthquake is the most powerful and effective option, dealing 4x damage due to Magnezone's Electric/Steel typing. This should be enough to defeat Magnezone given its current HP.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Swampert is critically low on HP and vulnerable to the next attack. Since the opponent needs to choose a new Pokémon, this is an ideal opportunity to switch to a stronger Pokémon. Dragonite has the highest HP remaining and is a versatile attacker, making it the best choice for facing an unknown opponent.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Dragonite is critically low on HP and vulnerable to Lugia's Psychic attacks. Earthquake won't be effective against the Flying-type Lugia, and Fire Punch isn't very powerful. It's best to switch to a Pokémon with better type matchup and more HP. Zapdos, being an Electric type, has an advantage against Lugia's Flying type and has more HP remaining.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Tyranitar is the best choice in this situation. It has the highest remaining HP (58/140) among the available Pokémon, giving it the best chance to survive. More importantly, Tyranitar's Dark type gives it a significant advantage against Lugia's Psychic type, as Dark is immune to Psychic moves. Additionally, Tyranitar's Rock type provides resistance to Lugia's Flying-type moves. While Tyranitar's Rock type is weak to Lugia's potential Water-type moves, the overall type matchup is favorable. Tyranitar also has strong offensive stats to potentially deal significant damage to Lugia.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Tyranitar has a type advantage against Lugia with its Rock-type move. Rock Slide is super effective against Flying-type Pokémon like Lugia. Additionally, Tyranitar's Dark typing provides resistance to Lugia's Psychic attacks. With Tyranitar having decent HP remaining and being our strongest active Pokémon, it's best to stay in and use our most effective move.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: The opponent's Lugia has fainted, and they need to choose a new Pokémon. This presents an opportunity to potentially set up or deal significant damage to their next Pokémon. Given that Tyranitar still has a decent amount of HP left (58/140), it's worth keeping it in battle for now. Since we don't know what Pokémon the opponent will send out next, it's best to use a move that has good coverage and power. Earthquake is a strong move with 100 power and 100 accuracy, making it a reliable choice against a wide range of Pokémon types. It could be especially effective if the opponent sends out a Fire, Electric, Rock, or Steel type.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Our Tyranitar is critically low on HP with only 3 HP remaining. While we've just defeated Kyogre, the opponent will be sending out a new Pokémon. Given Tyranitar's vulnerability, it's strategically better to switch to a Pokémon with more HP. Dragonite has the most HP left among our available Pokémon and doesn't have any known type disadvantages against the opponent's team. Switching to Dragonite will give us a better chance to continue the battle effectively.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Dragonite is immune to Ground-type moves due to its Flying type, which gives us an advantage against Groudon's Earthquake. Groudon is weak to Dragon-type moves, but we don't have any. Fire Punch won't be very effective against Groudon, but it's our best offensive option. With Groudon at low HP, we have a chance to finish it off. Switching to our other remaining Pokémon (Tyranitar or Swampert) would be risky due to their low HP and vulnerability to Groudon's moves.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: I choose to send out Swampert. While both Tyranitar and Swampert have low HP, Swampert has a clear type advantage against Groudon. As a Water-type, Swampert's attacks will be super effective against the Ground-type Groudon. Additionally, Swampert's Ground-type gives it immunity to Groudon's Electric-type moves if it has any. Swampert also has slightly more HP remaining than Tyranitar, which could be crucial in this situation. Given Groudon's low remaining HP, Swampert has a good chance of finishing the battle with a strong Water-type move.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Swampert is at critically low HP and unlikely to survive another hit. However, it has a type advantage against Groudon with its Water-type move Surf. Given that Groudon is also low on HP, our best chance is to attempt a knockout with Surf before Groudon can attack. Switching to Tyranitar would be risky due to its extremely low HP and vulnerability to Groudon's Earthquake.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: We just defeated Ho-Oh, and the opponent needs to choose a new Pokémon. Since we don't know what Pokémon they'll send out next, it's best to keep our current Pokémon, Swampert, active. Swampert has a diverse move set that can handle various types. We should wait to see what Pokémon the opponent chooses before deciding on our next move.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Given the limited options, Tyranitar is the only choice available. Despite its low HP, it has a type advantage against Groudon as Rock-type moves are super effective against Ground-type Pokémon. Tyranitar's high Attack stat could potentially allow it to finish off the weakened Groudon with a powerful Rock-type move. However, its low Speed and critically low HP make this a risky play. It's a last-stand situation where Tyranitar might be able to deal significant damage before fainting, potentially setting up for a win with the next Pokémon.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620's Reasoning: Tyranitar is our last Pokémon and has very low HP. Groudon is also low on HP. Our best chance is to use our strongest move that has type advantage. Rock Slide is super effective against Groudon (Ground type) and has the highest accuracy among our powerful moves. It's our best shot at defeating Groudon before we faint.

gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: My Swampert is facing an opposing Swampert, which is a Water/Ground type. My Swampert has Ice Beam, which is a super-effective (2x) move against Ground-type Pokémon. Both Surf (Water) and Earthquake (Ground) would be not very effective (0.5x) against the opponent's Water/Ground typing. Therefore, Ice Beam is the optimal move to use.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: My Swampert is at critically low HP (67/140) and took significant damage from the opponent's Earthquake in the last turn, indicating it will likely be knocked out if hit again. The opponent's active Pokémon is also Swampert (Water/Ground type). My Venusaur (Grass/Poison type) has a strong type advantage against Water/Ground Pokémon, being 4x effective with Grass-type moves. Additionally, Venusaur resists Ground-type attacks, making it a safe switch-in to absorb another potential Earthquake and gain offensive momentum.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Swampert's Earthquake is super effective against Venusaur (due to its Poison typing) and could deal significant damage. Switching to Gengar, which is a Ghost/Poison type, provides immunity to Ground-type moves like Earthquake, effectively nullifying Swampert's strongest attack against Venusaur and minimizing damage.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Gengar's Shadow Ball (Ghost type) will deal neutral damage to Zapdos (Electric/Flying) but receives STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) because Gengar is a Ghost-type Pokémon. This makes Shadow Ball's effective power 120 (80 base * 1.5 STAB), which is higher than Thunderbolt's effective power of 90 (90 base, no STAB). Since Gengar is at full HP and can deal a significant neutral hit, attacking is the best immediate action.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Gengar is at critically low HP and will likely be knocked out by another Thunderbolt. Swampert, being a Ground/Water type, is immune to Electric-type attacks like Zapdos's Thunderbolt. Switching to Swampert provides a safe switch-in and allows me to preserve Gengar.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Blissey has extremely high Special Defense and low Physical Defense. Earthquake is a powerful physical attack that will be more effective against Blissey's lower physical defense compared to Swampert's special attacks, even without a type advantage.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: The opponent's Pokémon, Blissey, has fainted, meaning I cannot select an attack. This is an opportune moment to switch out my current Pokémon, Swampert, which is at half health. Switching to Dragonite, who is at full health, allows me to maintain strong offensive pressure and defensive presence for the opponent's next Pokémon, regardless of their choice.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Dragonite is at low HP (70/131) and Gengar is at full HP. While Dragonite's Earthquake is super-effective against Gengar's Poison typing, it might not be enough to secure a KO, leaving Dragonite vulnerable to being knocked out by Gengar's next attack (Shadow Ball previously dealt 61 damage). Switching to Swampert (Water/Ground) is a safer option as it takes neutral damage from Gengar's Shadow Ball and can hit Gengar with super-effective Ground-type moves.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Opponent's Gengar is a fast Special Attacker with full HP. My Metagross, while offensively strong against Gengar's Poison typing, has a crippling 4x weakness to Ghost-type attacks (Gengar's primary STAB), making it too risky. My own Gengar is almost fainted, and Venusaur is at a type disadvantage. Jolteon, being at full HP and significantly faster than Gengar, can outspeed and attack first. While its Electric type offers no super-effective damage, hitting neutrally and absorbing neutral damage is a safer play than risking a critical hit on a 4x weakness.

gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Jolteon's Electric-type moves (Thunderbolt, Thunder) are not very effective against Gengar (Ghost/Poison). Jolteon's Shadow Ball, a Ghost-type move, deals neutral damage to Gengar. Since Jolteon is likely faster than Gengar, using Shadow Ball allows Jolteon to hit first with the most damaging option available against Gengar's typing, while Jolteon is at full HP.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Gengar is at extremely low HP (15/110). Jolteon's Shadow Ball is a Ghost-type move, which is super effective against Gengar (Ghost/Poison), and it has 100% accuracy. The previous turn's log shows Shadow Ball dealt 95 damage, which is more than enough to finish off Gengar's remaining 15 HP. Using Shadow Ball ensures a guaranteed knockout this turn.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Jolteon's Electric-type moves are completely ineffective against Swampert due to its Ground typing. Furthermore, Swampert's Earthquake would be super-effective against Jolteon and likely knock it out given its low HP. Switching to Dragonite is a safe play as Dragonite is immune to Ground-type attacks like Earthquake, neutralizing Swampert's strongest STAB move and giving me a free turn to attack or strategize.

gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Dragonite's Earthquake is a Ground-type move, which is super effective against Metagross's Steel typing (2x effectiveness). It also has a higher base power (100) compared to Fire Punch (75). Given Metagross has full HP, using the most powerful super-effective move is the best strategy.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: The opponent's Metagross is at very low HP (33/120). Jolteon is an excellent choice to finish it off. Jolteon's Electric-type attacks are super effective against Metagross's Steel typing. Furthermore, Jolteon has a much higher Speed (110) than the opponent's Metagross (66), ensuring it will attack first. Given the opponent's extremely low HP, a super-effective hit from Jolteon should be sufficient to secure the knockout before Metagross can even retaliate, mitigating Jolteon's own lower HP.

gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Jolteon is at low HP and is an Electric type, making it extremely vulnerable to Metagross's Rock Slide. Switching to my own Metagross, which is a Steel/Psychic type, will allow me to resist Rock Slide (taking 0.5x damage) and bring in a full-health Pokémon to deal with the opponent's Metagross.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Metagross is at full HP and has two super-effective moves against Salamence, which is a Dragon/Flying type. Earthquake (Ground) and Rock Slide (Rock) both hit Salamence for 2x damage due to its Flying typing. Earthquake has higher base power (100) and perfect accuracy (100) compared to Rock Slide (75 power, 90 accuracy), making it the superior choice to deal significant damage.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Metagross is at very low HP (16/120) and is likely to be knocked out by Salamence's next attack, especially if it's Fire Blast (which is super effective against Steel-type Metagross). My active move Earthquake is ineffective. While Rock Slide is super effective, Metagross won't survive to use it effectively. Switching to Jolteon (Electric type) is a strategic move as it resists Flying-type attacks from Salamence (though Fire Blast is not resisted) and can deal super effective damage with an Electric-type move. Jolteon also has more HP than Metagross.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Given the critically low HP of both Metagross and Gengar, Venusaur is the only viable option that can withstand an attack from Salamence. While Venusaur (Grass/Poison) does not have a type advantage against Salamence (Dragon/Flying) and its attacks would be resisted, its significant remaining HP makes it the only Pokémon capable of staying in the fight for more than one turn. Sending out Metagross or Gengar would result in an immediate faint.

gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Jolteon fainted, necessitating a switch-in. Among my remaining non-fainted Pokémon, Venusaur is the only one with significant HP (96/120) and is the most suitable choice to send out against Salamence. Metagross and Gengar are critically low on HP and not viable.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Venusaur's attacks are highly ineffective against Salamence due to its Flying type (Earthquake does no damage, Sludge Bomb is resisted). Venusaur also has very low HP and is likely to be knocked out next turn regardless of action. Switching to Metagross, despite its equally low HP, provides a resistance to Dragon-type moves like Dragon Claw, offering a slim chance to survive if Salamence uses that move instead of Fire Blast, which Metagross is weak to. Staying in with Venusaur would result in a wasted turn.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Both available Pokémon are at very low HP. While Venusaur has slightly more remaining HP, its Grass typing is super-resisted by Salamence's Dragon/Flying typing, making it unable to deal meaningful damage. Gengar's Ghost-type attacks, despite its critically low HP, are at least neutral against Salamence, giving it a chance to deal some chip damage before fainting. This makes Gengar the slightly better offensive option in a desperate situation.

gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Gengar's Thunderbolt move is Super Effective against Salamence's Flying typing, providing the best chance to deal significant damage. Gengar also has a type advantage being immune to Salamence's Earthquake, although its low HP makes it vulnerable to other attacks.


gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: Venusaur is at low HP and its Grass/Poison typing is severely disadvantaged against Salamence's Dragon/Flying typing (Grass and Poison moves are resisted by both Dragon and Flying). However, as Venusaur is the only available Pokémon, it must be sent out.

gemini-2.5-flash's Reasoning: All other Pokémon are fainted, so I cannot switch. Venusaur must attack. Sludge Bomb (Poison) is a better offensive option against Salamence (Dragon/Flying) than Earthquake (Ground). Poison moves are neutral against both Dragon and Flying types, while Ground is not very effective against Flying types.
